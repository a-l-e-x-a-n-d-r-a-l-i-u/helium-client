They do not represent my interests.\n\nI respectfully call on you to:\n\n1.      Use the taxon Canis dingo and term dingo, not ‘wild dog’, when communicating with stakeholders, so that it is clear what animal is being targeted / killed.\n\n2.      Lobby the Minister for the Environment to approve nomination for dingo loss as a key threatening process under the EPBC Act.\n\n3.      Abandon the current National Wild Dog Action Plan and produce a new framework that prioritises the perspectives of Aboriginal people, independent ecologists and the general public.\n\n4.      Take responsibility for decisions about dingoes’ future away from industry organisations with a vested interest in current management techniques and profits over public interests\n\n5.      Ban cruel and indiscriminate use of 1080 and strychnine poison in Australia.\n\n6.      Invest in research and pilot programs for non-lethal livestock protection methods with a view to developing long term, sustainable strategies for dingoes and livestock to safely co-exist within the Australian landscape.\n\nREASONS FOR MY REQUEST\n\nDingoes are a majestic, keystone native Australian species.\n\nThe dingo is recognised as a native Australian species under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 section 528 which defines a native species as one that was present in Australia before the year 1400 (2).\n\nDingoes have many physical and behavioural features that distinguish them from other canids. These features allow them to survive in challenging Australian environments (3).\n\nDingoes have been incorporated into Aboriginal society. They are widely recognised as part of creation, “dreaming” knowledge and law (4, 5).\n\nDingoes are valued globally as an iconic Australian species.\n\nAs a native apex predator dingoes play a critical role in ecosystem resilience and stability (6-10). Their role includes:\n\n- Picking off old, sick and genetically weak individuals, slowing the spread of disease and ensuring healthy populations of their prey species.\n- Preying on both introduced and native herbivores, regulating the number of kangaroos, rabbits, feral pigs etc resulting in improved vegetation cover.\n- Keeping foxes and feral cats in check, which in turn gives life to many small-medium mammals, marsupials, native birds and other species.\n\nThe taxonomic status of dingoes is political and contentious. Science is proving that dingoes are a distinct species (Canis dingo) – genetically, behaviourally, morphologically (10) - and yet vested interests promote them as ‘wild dogs’, ‘pests’ or ‘feral’ domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) to justify lethal control (11, 12). A major recent study of public understandings found that most people (over 80%) were not aware that the targets of “wild dog” management included dingoes. Most respondents considered dingoes native to Australia (over 80%) and there was low level of approval of lethal control of dingoes (13).\n\nFailure to recognise dingoes as a separate species, misinformation that they are an ‘introduced’ species and / or exaggerated claims of hybridisation with domestic dogs diminishes their critical role as Australia’s native apex land predators\n\nThis mess of terminology is misleading and confusing. Language and classifications used by government should be supported by independent scientists, not dictated by industry / industry affiliated ‘experts’.\n\nDingoes may prey upon sheep and, sometimes, cattle especially if the stock are weak or there is a lack of other prey (increased stock predation has been associated with poor husbandry practices and biodiversity destruction) (14).\n\nIn response to perceived risks to stock, dingoes are being killed on an industrial scale across Australia through widespread ‘lethal control’ under the National Wild Dog Action Plan (15). Methods include trapping, shooting and, most commonly poisoning, including aerial dropping of 1080. The RSPCA does not regard 1080 or traps as humane. Traps incorporating strychnine laced clothes are considered to be especially cruel (16, 17).\n\nHowever, the real scale of threat posed by dingoes to the wool and meat livestock industries is small. For example, in New South Wales and Victoria annual sheep losses are reported as less than 0.01% of the total flock. ‘Wild dog’ predation accounts for only a fraction of this (18). Research conducted in central and Northern Australia has shown lethal control of dingoes does not reduce cattle production impacts (19, 20). A growing number of producers are reporting that dingoes can be valuable partners in agriculture (21).\n\nThe Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) is the Australian Government's principal piece of environment legislation (2).\n\nThe EPBC Act aims to protect Australia's native species and ecological communities by providing for:\n\n- Identification and listing of species as threatened\n- Recognition of key threatening processes\n- The dingo has been frequently nominated for protection under the EPBC Act as a threatened species and dingo loss as a key threatening process, due to the cascading effects of the loss or removal of dingoes from Australian landscapes (22, 23)\n\nIn 2017 the Threatened Species Scientific Committee recommended that dingo loss be included in the proposed priority assessment list for key threatening processes. This decision was rejected by the then Environment Minister and was consequently excluded from consideration thereafter (23).\n\nAustralia’s Framework for dingo management is the ‘National Wild Dog Action Plan’ (The Plan). This Plan is extremely dangerous for dingoes’ survival as a species.\n\nThe Plan is a \"livestock industry-driven initiative\". The copyright for the Plan is held by © 2020 Australian Wool Innovation Ltd. It unabashedly represents the interests of meat livestock, wool and pesticide industry operators over the interests of the environment, culture and dingoes (15).\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.      Philip, J.

More than 211,100 people from Afghanistan have applied for humanitarian protection so far. Australia has a moral obligation to provide at least 20,000 emergency humanitarian visa places immediately.\n\nToday, more than 71,500 people from Afghanistan call Australia home and contribute to Australia’s prosperity in our schools, hospitals, construction sites, in academia and more.\n\nIn light of this history and engagement between our two nations, I urge you to join the growing number of public voices and take proactive measures to secure:\n\n- At least 20,000 emergency additional humanitarian visas for people escaping danger in Afghanistan.\n\n- Granting of permanent protection to refugees from Afghanistan already in Australia on temporary visas. These people now face a heightened state of insecurity and cannot continue to live in limbo.\n\n- Prioritising partner and family reunification visas of people from Afghanistan who are currently awaiting to be reunited with their family members in safety in Australia.\n\n- Expediting the resettlement of translators, guides, Afghan National Defense and Security Forces and other personnel who assisted Australian and allied forces in the preceding 20 year military engagement.\n\n- Lifting the ban on resettlement of refugees to Australia through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Indonesia.\n\n- The provision of urgent humanitarian aid for the millions of people including children in Afghanistan facing starvation.\n\nI urge you and your fellow MPs to please consider the action points and voice your strong support for continuing Australia’s long relationship with the people of Afghanistan.\n\nI look forward to your response.\n"},{"id":10,"title":"Open Letter opposing Star Casino Redevelopment","author":"Greater Sydney Community","date":"March 2, 2019","tag":"addiction","content":"\nI do not support the current proposal and concur with the Open Letter to the Independent Planning Commission, published in the SMH on Monday, 26 August 2019.\n"}]
