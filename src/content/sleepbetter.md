If you sleep with your phone on your nightstand, it can be tempting to scroll through emails and social media, or check every notification instead of getting some rest.

Pixel 7 Pro, Pixel 7 and Pixel 6a come with features that can help you avoid this. Flip to Shhh puts your phone into Do Not Disturb mode when laid face down, and Digital Wellbeing lets you manage time spent on your phone and set limits on certain websites or apps. When itâ€™s in Bedtime mode, Pixel can also help you understand the quality of your sleep by using AI to analyze audio from coughs and snores during the night.
